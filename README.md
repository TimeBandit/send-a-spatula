# send-a-spatula

A Meteor 1.3 portfolio project

Inspired by the plethora of 'potato posting' websites, I created this web application around the idea of allowing customers to send customised spatulas anonymously to people. It is fully functional and secure and yes I will send a spatula should someone make a purchase.

For the technically minded. This application was written entirely in Javascript using React for the DOM and the getskeleton css framework for the layout. It integrates Stripe Checkout for payments and the Twitter API for retrieving tweets. It is hosted on Digital Ocean.
